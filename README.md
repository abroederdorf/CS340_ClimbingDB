Final project for databases course. This database allows you to track information about routes, climbers, skills, and routes climbed by adding, modifying, and removing data. There are several pre-created filters to query the data to search for routes, climbing partners, and climb history. This project includes SQL, PHP, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
